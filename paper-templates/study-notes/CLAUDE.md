# {paper_name}

A project for exploratory learning. Dive deep into a topic and organize notes as Markdown documents.

## Structure

- `chapters/` — Chapter-by-chapter notes (`NN-slug.md` format)
- `figures/` — Images, diagrams

## Writing Rules

- All documents are written in Markdown (.md)
- Math: `$...$` (inline), `$$...$$` (block)
- Always specify language tags in code blocks
- Keep chapter filenames numbered (`01-`, `02-`, ...)
- Save figures in `figures/`, reference with relative paths
- No build step — preview directly as Markdown
